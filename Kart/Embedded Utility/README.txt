Sorry, Java's buggy on my home computer so its text only.
Contact me if you really need the jar file, I'll get you a copy somehow 
This program performs the following (built using Java7u55, tested and works with Java6,Java7 and Java8u5):
1) Decimal Float to IEEE-754 Float (32bit)
2) IEEE-754 Float (32bit) to Decimal Float
3) Checksum
4) CRC-16, with configurable seed (reversed, for example if CRC is 0xABCD, it displays as CDAB )
