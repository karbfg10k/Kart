This matlab project takes an image and perform text extraction to ideally leave just the text behind.

Change 'I.png' to the name of your image. It needs to be in the same folder as the Project.m file.
I = imread('I.png');

Code's pretty well commented, so it's easy to understand what Image Processing techniques are used.
